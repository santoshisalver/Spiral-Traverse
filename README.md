# Spiral Matrix Traversal with Turtle Graphics

## Description

This Python program visualizes the traversal of a matrix in *spiral order* using the Turtle graphics library.
Rather than filling a matrix with numbers, the program draws *lines* to represent the movement as the traversal follows the typical spiral pattern.

The program simulates the concept of a spiral matrix traversal — where the algorithm moves right, down, left, and up — shrinking the boundaries after each full cycle until it reaches the center.

### Key Features:
- Visual representation of spiral matrix traversal using Python's *Turtle* library.
- The program draws *lines* as the spiral is formed, providing a clear, animated view of the traversal order.
- The traversal pattern mimics how you would traverse a matrix in spiral order, but instead of numbers, *lines* are drawn to visualize each step.

## How It Works

The program works by:
1. Starting at the top-left corner of the "matrix."
2. Moving right, down, left, and up in a loop, adjusting the bounds after each complete cycle.
3. The turtle continues to draw lines, following this sequence until the entire grid is traversed in a spiral pattern.
